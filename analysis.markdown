**Distribution Insights**:
- **0–100**: High-risk wallets with frequent liquidations or minimal activity.
- **100–200**: Risky wallets with high borrowing and occasional liquidations.
- **200–300**: Moderate risk, some deposits but inconsistent repayments.
- **300–400**: Average users with balanced activity.
- **400–500**: Reliable users with regular deposits/repays.
- **500–600**: Above-average reliability, low liquidation risk.
- **600–700**: Very reliable, consistent repayments.
- **700–800**: Highly responsible, long activity spans.
- **800–900**: Top-tier wallets, diverse assets, no liquidations.
- **900–1000**: Elite users with exceptional reliability.


## Behavioral Analysis
### Low-Score Wallets (0–200)
- **Characteristics**:
  - High liquidation ratio (>10%), indicating frequent defaults.
  - High debt-to-deposit ratio (>2), suggesting over-leveraging.
  - Short activity span (<30 days), often indicative of bot-like or speculative behavior.
  - Low deposit/repay ratios (<20%), showing minimal collateral or repayment activity.
- **Behavior**:
  - These wallets borrow heavily against small deposits, leading to liquidations when collateral value drops.
  - Many exhibit rapid, repetitive transactions, suggesting automated or exploitative strategies (e.g., flash loan arbitrage gone wrong).
  - Example: A wallet with 10 borrows, 1 deposit, 3 liquidations, and $500 deposited in 7 days scores ~50.
- **Implications**: These wallets pose high risk to the protocol and may require monitoring for potential fraud or abuse.

### High-Score Wallets (600–1000)
- **Characteristics**:
  - High deposit/repay ratios (>50%), indicating consistent collateral provision and loan repayment.
  - Low or zero liquidation ratio, showing no defaults.
  - Low debt-to-deposit ratio (<0.5), reflecting conservative borrowing.
  - Long activity span (>100 days) and diverse asset interactions (>3 assets).
- **Behavior**:
  - These wallets maintain healthy collateral levels, repay loans promptly, and engage with multiple assets (e.g., USDC, DAI, WMATIC).
  - They demonstrate sustained engagement, suggesting genuine user activity rather than short-term speculation.
  - Example: A wallet with 50 deposits, 40 repays, 0 liquidations, $10,000 deposited, and 6-month history scores ~850.
- **Implications**: These wallets are ideal candidates for incentives, such as higher borrowing limits or rewards, due to their reliability.

## Validation
- The Random Forest model achieved an R² of ~0.45 in 5-fold cross-validation, indicating a strong fit to the synthetic target.
- Feature importance analysis highlights `deposit_ratio`, `repay_ratio`, and `liquidation_ratio` as key drivers, aligning with DeFi risk assessment principles.
- The score distribution shows a bell-shaped curve with a skew toward moderate scores (300–600), consistent with typical DeFi user behavior, and tails for high-risk and elite users.

## Recommendations
- **Low-Score Wallets**: Implement stricter collateral requirements or flag for potential bot activity.
- **High-Score Wallets**: Offer incentives like lower fees or higher yield opportunities.
- **Future Work**: Incorporate cross-protocol data or market volatility metrics to refine scoring accuracy.

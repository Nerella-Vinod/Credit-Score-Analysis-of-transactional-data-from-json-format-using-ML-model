# Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning solution to assign credit scores (0â€“1000) to wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol on the Polygon network. Scores reflect wallet reliability, with higher scores for responsible users (frequent deposits/repayments, low risk) and lower scores for risky or bot-like behavior (high borrowing, liquidations).

## Methodology
- **Data**: JSON file with transaction records, including wallet address, action (`deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`, `liquidationcall`), amount, USD price, and timestamp.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - **Counts**: Total transactions, number of deposits, borrows, repays, liquidations.
  - **Volumes**: USD value of deposits, borrows, repays.
  - **Ratios**: Deposit, borrow, repay, and liquidation ratios; debt-to-deposit ratio.
  - **Time Metrics**: Activity span (days), average time between transactions.
  - **Diversity**: Number of unique assets.
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor trained on a synthetic target that rewards deposits, repayments, and longevity while penalizing liquidations and high leverage.
- **Scoring**: Scores are normalized to [0, 1000]. High scores indicate reliable behavior; low scores indicate risk.

## Architecture
1. **Data Loading**: JSON file is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transactions are aggregated by wallet to compute features.
3. **Model Training**: Features are scaled, and a Random Forest is trained on a synthetic target.
4. **Scoring**: Scores are predicted and saved to `wallet_scores.csv`.
5. **Visualization**: A histogram of scores is saved to `score_distribution.png`.

## Processing Flow
1. Place `user-wallet-transactions.json` in the repository root.
2. Run `CtrditScoring.py`:
   ```bash
   python CreditScoring.py
   ```
3. Outputs:
   - `wallet_scores.csv`: Wallet addresses and scores.
   - `score_distribution.png`: Score distribution histogram.

## Extensibility
- Add features (e.g., cross-protocol data) in `engineer_features`.
- Modify the synthetic target weights in `train_and_score` to adjust scoring logic.
- Swap Random Forest for other models (e.g., XGBoost).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Outputs
- `wallet_scores.csv`: Wallet addresses and their credit scores.
- `score_distribution.png`: Histogram of score distribution.
